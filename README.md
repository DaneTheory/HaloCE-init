Halo CD Dedicated Server Init
===========

An init file I wrote to run Halo CE Dedicated Server on my Headless Ubuntu Server as a service. This script could be easily ported over to other init systems.

## Dependencies
wine - Used to run the Halo Windows Program on Linux.

xvfb - Used to emulate a display for the GUI program.

tmux - Used to allow console access from the command line.
